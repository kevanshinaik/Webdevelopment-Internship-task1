PYTHON PROJECT

Python offers multiple options for developing GUI (Graphical User Interface). Out of all the GUI methods, tkinter is the most commonly used method. It is a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit shipped with Python. Python with tkinter outputs the fastest and easiest way to create the GUI applications. 

To create a tkinter : 

Importing the module – tkinter
Create the main window (container)
Add any number of widgets to the main window.
Apply the event Trigger on the widgets.

Modules required:  
tkinter
requests
json

Steps of Building the Python Project on Currency Converter

1. Real-time Exchange rates
2. Import required Libraries
3. CurrencyConverter Class
4. UI for CurrencyConverter
5. Main Function

To get real-time exchange rates, i have use: https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/USD
Base – USD: It means we have our base currency USD. which means to convert any currency we have to first convert it to USD then from USD, we will convert it in whichever currency we want.

Date and time: It shows the last updated date and time.

Rates: It is the exchange rate of currencies with base currency USD

PLATFORM WHICH IS USED IN THE PROJECT:

PYTHON IDLE: It is an integrated development environment for Python, which has been bundled with the default implementation of the language since 1.5.2b1. It is packaged as an optional part of the Python packaging with many Linux distributions. It is completely written in Python and the Tkinter GUI toolkit
